        <p>
            A waffle is a cake-like food made from leavened batter when it is poured between two hot, 
            patterned plates. Waffles come in a variety of shapes and sizes and they are eaten all over 
            the world. Belgian waffles are an American version of a original recipe invented in Brussels, 
            where they are made in a disc-shaped pattern. While traditionally served at breakfast, waffles 
            can also work well as a snack or dessert. This particular recipe will yeild 8 servings.

            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 ¾ cups warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now let's get on to it. Follow the instructions listed below and you'll be all set to enjoy.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of the warm milk and the melted butter. 
                Stir in the yeast mixture, sugar, salt and vanilla. Stir in the remaining 2 1/2 cups milk 
                alternately with the flour, ending with the flour. Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks; 
                fold into the batter. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled 
                in volume, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the waffle iron. Brush with oil and spoon about 1/2 cup (or as recommended by 
                manufacturer) onto center of iron. Close the lid and bake until it stops steaming and 
                the waffle is golden brown. Serve immediately or keep warm in 200 degree oven.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>Well done, pal!</p> 
        <p>
            Personal recommendation: pour on them some honey and add some red or blue 
            berries on the top and it'll feel like heaven on earth!</p>
